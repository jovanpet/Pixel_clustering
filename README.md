# Pixel_clustering
The app takes in pictures and upon decison from the user clusters pixels to the picked number of colors. This is often used in preparing data for machine learing. The photo's location is given to the program and results are stored in another file.

The input pictures must be .PPM and the output is .PPM so to view the result you need to convert it.
